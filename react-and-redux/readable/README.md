> Second project: React and Redux App for the udacity ng.
 
## Installing / Getting started

You will need to add the development server from [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter), for the project to work properly. It should be running on `localhost:3001`.
Or you can use the copy version in the project folder ``api-server``.
```shell
npm install && npm start
```


Go to the frontend project folder ``frontend``.
Run the following command to get up and running:

```shell
npm install && npm start
```

The above command will install all dependencies and open the project in development mode, in you default browser, on port 3000.
> Please use a modern Firefox or Chrome. The Layout is self made. The reason was: learning and using CSS Flexbox, CSS Animation and CSS Grid.
