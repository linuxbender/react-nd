# UdaciFitness

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and runs on the Expo client. Run `npm start` to build the Expo app. You will need an Expo client on the phone to see the compiled app during development.

### Build and Deploy

The easiest way to generate both the .apk and the .ipa files is to use Expo's `exp` CLI. First, run `npm install -g exp`. Once that's installed (and after you've configured your `app.json` file), you can run `exp build:ios` to build your .ipa file, and `exp build:android` to build your .apk file.

Enter 1 to have Expo handle the keystore part of the build process.

Use `exp build:status` to track the progress of the build. Once the build is ready, this command will return a link to an .ipa (iOS) or .apk (Android) file. These are standalone binaries for your application. Download the binary at the link. You can now upload the binary to the respective App store for review & distribution.
